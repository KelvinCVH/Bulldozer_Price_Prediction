# Bulldozer_Price_Prediction
This is the repository to predict the prize of the bulldozers given by the features. This project is based on the Blue Book for Bulldozers from Kaggle Competition hosted in year 2012.

There are multiple data science and machine learning libraries used to build this price prediction regression model which include Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn. 

The machine learning model used for this competition is using Random Forest Regressor. The evaluation metrics for this bulldozers price prediction model is by evaluating the Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE), the model has successfully evaluated with a RMLSE of 24.52%, which is equivalent to rank 35 in the competition.
